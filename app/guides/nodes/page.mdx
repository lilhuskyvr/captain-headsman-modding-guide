# Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of every prisoner sequence. A sequence is a chain of nodes that starts from a character's `defaultNodeIds` and ends when a terminal node resolves.

**`$type`:** `Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp`

---

## Common fields

Every node file shares these fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique identifier. Referenced by other nodes and by characters. |
| `nodeType` | string | yes | Which node behaviour to use. See node types below. |

---

## Node types

### `DialogueNode`

Plays an interrogation exchange between the Headsman and the prisoner, then advances to the next node. This is the standard opening beat of a sequence.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `nextNodeIds` | string[] | One or more node ids to advance to after the exchange. One is picked at random. |
| `exchanges` | string[][] | Pool of dialogue exchanges. See the [Exchanges](/guides/exchanges) guide. |

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "my_interrogation",
  "nodeType": "DialogueNode",
  "nextNodeIds": ["execute_or_release"],
  "exchanges": [
    [
      "What is your name?",
      "Why does it matter?",
      "It doesn't. Tell me anyway.",
      "{prisonerName}. There. Satisfied?"
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

### `OptionNode`

Presents the player with a list of labelled buttons. Each button routes to a different node. This is the verdict screen.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `options` | Option[] | List of buttons. Each option has a `text` label and a `nodeId` destination. |

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "execute_or_release",
  "nodeType": "OptionNode",
  "options": [
    { "text": "Execute",           "nodeId": "execute_prisoner"           },
    { "text": "Strip and Execute", "nodeId": "strip_and_execute_prisoner" },
    { "text": "Strip",             "nodeId": "strip_prisoner"             },
    { "text": "Strip and Dismiss", "nodeId": "strip_and_dismiss_prisoner" },
    { "text": "Release",           "nodeId": "release_prisoner"           }
  ]
}
```

---

### `ExecutePrisonerNode`

Plays a last-words exchange and then triggers the execution sequence.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `headsmanFirst` | boolean | When `true`, the Headsman speaks first. When `false`, the prisoner speaks first. Defaults to `false`. |
| `exchanges` | string[][] | Pool of last-words exchanges. |

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "execute_prisoner",
  "nodeType": "ExecutePrisonerNode",
  "headsmanFirst": false,
  "exchanges": [
    [
      "Do it. I have nothing left to say.",
      "As you wish."
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

### `StripAndExecutePrisonerNode`

Same as `ExecutePrisonerNode` but strips the prisoner before execution.

**Additional fields:** `headsmanFirst`, `exchanges` — identical to `ExecutePrisonerNode`.

---

### `StripPrisonerNode`

Strips the prisoner and ends the sequence (the prisoner is not released and not executed — they are left stripped).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `exchanges` | string[][] | Pool of single-line prisoner reactions. Each exchange is a one-element array containing a single prisoner line. The Headsman does not speak. |

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "strip_prisoner",
  "nodeType": "StripPrisonerNode",
  "exchanges": [
    ["You have no right."],
    ["Don't touch me."],
    ["Is this really necessary?"]
  ]
}
```

---

### `StripAndDismissPrisonerNode`

Strips the prisoner and releases them.

**Additional fields:** `exchanges` — same format as `StripPrisonerNode`.

---

### `ReleasePrisonerNode`

Releases the prisoner without harm.

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "release_prisoner",
  "nodeType": "ReleasePrisonerNode",
  "exchanges": [
    [
      "I can go?",
      "Walk. Don't make me reconsider."
    ]
  ]
}
```

---

### `CaptureRebelNode`

Internal node that handles the capture moment. No modder-facing fields beyond `id` and `nodeType`. Included here for completeness.

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "capture_rebel",
  "nodeType": "CaptureRebelNode"
}
```

---

## Wiring nodes together

Every sequence must eventually resolve to a terminal node (Execute, Strip, Strip and Dismiss, or Release). A typical chain:

```
[Character.defaultNodeIds]
        ↓
  DialogueNode           ← interrogation exchange
        ↓
  OptionNode             ← player chooses verdict
    ↓        ↓
Execute    Release       ← outcome nodes
```

You can insert additional `DialogueNode` or `OptionNode` steps anywhere in the chain.

---

## Default node ids

These are the built-in node ids shipped with the game. You can patch any of them by creating a file with the same `id`.

| `id` | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `capture_rebel` | `CaptureRebelNode` | Handles capture event |
| `male_rebel_interrogation` | `DialogueNode` | Opening interrogation for male rebels |
| `female_rebel_interrogation` | `DialogueNode` | Opening interrogation for female rebels |
| `execute_or_release` | `OptionNode` | Verdict screen |
| `execute_prisoner` | `ExecutePrisonerNode` | Clean execution |
| `strip_and_execute_prisoner` | `StripAndExecutePrisonerNode` | Strip then execute |
| `strip_prisoner` | `StripPrisonerNode` | Strip and leave |
| `strip_and_dismiss_prisoner` | `StripAndDismissPrisonerNode` | Strip and release |
| `release_prisoner` | `ReleasePrisonerNode` | Release without harm |

---

## Example: branching verdict screen

Add a "Make an example" route that strips and then executes:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "execute_or_release",
  "nodeType": "OptionNode",
  "options": [
    { "text": "Execute",          "nodeId": "execute_prisoner"           },
    { "text": "Make an example",  "nodeId": "strip_and_execute_prisoner" },
    { "text": "Release",          "nodeId": "release_prisoner"           }
  ]
}
```

## Example: second interrogation beat before verdict

Insert a second dialogue node between a custom interrogation and the verdict screen:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "my_interrogation",
  "nodeType": "DialogueNode",
  "nextNodeIds": ["my_second_beat"],
  "exchanges": [
    ["What is your name?", "None of your business."]
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "my_second_beat",
  "nodeType": "DialogueNode",
  "nextNodeIds": ["execute_or_release"],
  "exchanges": [
    ["Last chance. Anything to say?", "Nothing you'd want to hear."]
  ]
}
```
