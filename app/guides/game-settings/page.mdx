# Game Settings

The `GameSettings` data object controls global game-wide configuration: the prisoner name pools and which camera pivots the action camera may use during executions.

**`$type`:** `Scripts.DataComponents.GameSettingsDataObject, Assembly-CSharp`
**`id`:** `GameSettings` *(fixed — there is exactly one game settings object)*

---

## Fields

### `maleNames`

Array of strings. The game picks a random name from this list when generating a male prisoner.

```json
"maleNames": ["Aldric", "Edmund", "Godric", "Harold", "Wulfric"]
```

Modding this field **replaces the entire list**. If you want to extend the default pool rather than replace it, include all the names you want alongside your additions — the mod system does a shallow merge, not an append.

---

### `femaleNames`

Array of strings. Same as `maleNames` but for female prisoners.

```json
"femaleNames": ["Edith", "Maud", "Agnes", "Cecily", "Isolde"]
```

---

### `actionCameraPivots`

Array of strings. Each entry is the name of a camera pivot object in the scene. During an execution replay, the action camera picks shots from this list. Remove entries to suppress specific angles. Order is not significant.

**Default pivots:**

| Pivot name | Description |
|---|---|
| `ActionCameraLookAtFacePivot` | Close shot on the prisoner's face |
| `ActionCameraLookAtNeckFromTop` | Top-down look at the neck |
| `ActionCameraLookAtChestFromFront` | Mid-shot, chest height |
| `ActionCameraLookAtHipsFromBottom` | Low angle, hips |
| `ActionCameraLookAtHipsFromBehind` | Behind, hips level |
| `ActionCameraLookAtBackFromBehind` | Behind, back level |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointFront` | Frontal wide shot |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointBack` | Rear wide shot |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointLeft` | Left side |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointRight` | Right side |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointTopDown` | Directly overhead |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointHighFrontLeft` | Elevated front-left |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointHighFrontRight` | Elevated front-right |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointHighBackLeft` | Elevated rear-left |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointHighBackRight` | Elevated rear-right |
| `PrisonerSpawnPointOrbit` | Orbiting dynamic shot |

## Examples

### Replace the name pools entirely

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.GameSettingsDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "GameSettings",
  "maleNames":   ["Aldric", "Edmund", "Godric", "Harold", "Oswin"],
  "femaleNames": ["Edith", "Maud", "Agnes", "Cecily", "Isolde"]
}
```

### Restrict the action camera to face and overhead shots only

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.GameSettingsDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "GameSettings",
  "actionCameraPivots": [
    "ActionCameraLookAtFacePivot",
    "PrisonerSpawnPointTopDown"
  ]
}
```

### Disable the action camera entirely

Set `actionCameraPivots` to an empty array:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.GameSettingsDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "GameSettings",
  "actionCameraPivots": []
}
```

## Merging behaviour

Because the game shallow-merges files by `id`, you only need to include the fields you are changing. Array fields like `maleNames` are **replaced entirely** — not appended. To extend the defaults without replacing them, you must include the full default list plus your additions.

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.GameSettingsDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "GameSettings",
  "maleNames": ["Aldric", "Edmund", "Godric", "Harold", "Oswin"]
}
```
