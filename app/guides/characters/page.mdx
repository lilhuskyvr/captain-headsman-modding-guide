# Characters

A character definition controls which 3D model is used for a prisoner and which node sequences the game can start them on. The two default characters are `MaleRebel` and `FemaleRebel`.

**`$type`:** `Scripts.DataComponents.CharacterDataObject, Assembly-CSharp`

---

## Fields

### `id`

String. The unique identifier for this character. Used to reference the character elsewhere. Case-sensitive.

---

### `isMale`

Boolean. Determines which name pool is used when generating this character's name (`maleNames` or `femaleNames` from GameSettings).

```json
"isMale": true
```

---

### `addressableId`

String. The name of the Unity Addressable asset to load for this character's 3D model and rig. The built-in values are `"MaleRebel"` and `"FemaleRebel"`. Custom characters are not supported in the current version — set this to one of the two built-in values.

```json
"addressableId": "MaleRebel"
```

---

### `defaultNodeIds`

Array of strings. A pool of node `id` values the game can pick from as the starting node for this character's sequence. The game picks one at random each time this character is captured.

```json
"defaultNodeIds": ["male_rebel_interrogation"]
```

You can list multiple node ids here to randomise which interrogation sequence plays:

```json
"defaultNodeIds": [
  "male_rebel_interrogation",
  "my_custom_interrogation_a",
  "my_custom_interrogation_b"
]
```

---

### `canBeCaptured`

Boolean. When `false`, this character type will never be sent to the block — effectively disabling them. Defaults to `true` when omitted.

```json
"canBeCaptured": false
```

---

### `hairColors`

Array of hex colour strings. One colour is picked at random each time this character spawns and applied as a tint to their hair material. Leave the array empty (or omit the field) to keep the material's default colour.

```json
"hairColors": [
  "#0D0600",
  "#3B1A07",
  "#8B6A35",
  "#6E6560"
]
```

Replacing this array in a mod file **replaces the entire list** — the mod system does a shallow merge, not an append.

## Examples

### Patch an existing character

Point the male rebel at a custom interrogation node instead of the default:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.CharacterDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "MaleRebel",
  "defaultNodeIds": ["my_custom_interrogation"]
}
```

### Disable a character type

Prevent female rebels from appearing entirely:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.CharacterDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "FemaleRebel",
  "canBeCaptured": false
}
```

### Add multiple starting nodes for variety

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.CharacterDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "MaleRebel",
  "defaultNodeIds": [
    "male_rebel_interrogation",
    "my_hostile_rebel_start",
    "my_silent_rebel_start"
  ]
}
```

### Change hair colours

Give the male rebel lighter, sandy hair:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.CharacterDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "MaleRebel",
  "hairColors": [
    "#C8A045",
    "#D4B85A",
    "#B89030"
  ]
}
```

## Built-in characters

| `id` | `addressableId` | `isMale` |
|---|---|---|
| `MaleRebel` | `MaleRebel` | `true` |
| `FemaleRebel` | `FemaleRebel` | `false` |

> Custom character models are not supported in the current release. You must use `"MaleRebel"` or `"FemaleRebel"` as the `addressableId`.
