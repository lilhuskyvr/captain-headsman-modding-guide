# Exchanges

Exchanges are the dialogue pools used by `DialogueNode`, `ExecutePrisonerNode`, `StripAndExecutePrisonerNode`, `ReleasePrisonerNode`, and `StripPrisonerNode`. The game picks one exchange at random each time that node is reached.

---

## Format

`exchanges` is an array of arrays. Each inner array is one possible exchange. The game picks one inner array per event and plays its lines in order.

```json
"exchanges": [
  [ "line 0", "line 1", "line 2" ],
  [ "line 0", "line 1" ],
  [ "line 0", "line 1", "line 2", "line 3", "line 4" ]
]
```

---

## Speaker order

Lines within each inner array alternate speakers:

| Index | Speaker (default — `headsmanFirst: false`) |
|---|---|
| 0 | Prisoner |
| 1 | Headsman |
| 2 | Prisoner |
| 3 | Headsman |
| … | … |

When `headsmanFirst` is set to `true` on the node, the order flips:

| Index | Speaker (`headsmanFirst: true`) |
|---|---|
| 0 | Headsman |
| 1 | Prisoner |
| 2 | Headsman |
| 3 | Prisoner |
| … | … |

`DialogueNode` always uses `headsmanFirst: true` (the Headsman opens the interrogation).
`ExecutePrisonerNode` uses `headsmanFirst: false` by default (prisoner speaks last words first).

---

## `{prisonerName}` placeholder

Any line may contain `{prisonerName}`. The game replaces it at runtime with the prisoner's generated name.

```json
"I know who you are, {prisonerName}. Word travels.",
```

```json
"Then you know what I've done. Headsman.",
```

---

## `StripPrisonerNode` exchanges

`StripPrisonerNode` and `StripAndDismissPrisonerNode` use single-line exchanges — each inner array contains exactly one string: the prisoner's reaction. The Headsman does not speak during a strip.

```json
"exchanges": [
  ["You have no right."],
  ["Don't touch me."],
  ["Stop. Just stop."],
  ["Is this what you call justice?"]
]
```

## Writing guidelines

### Characters

- All rebels are between **19 and 25 years old**. Write their voices accordingly: raw, reactive, not yet smoothed over by age or experience.
- **They do not have children.** Never give a prisoner children of their own. Some have siblings — a brother conscripted, a sister who disappeared, a younger one still at home.
- They may have **killed the king's soldiers** and be unashamed of it. Do not soften this.
- **All of them hate the crown** to some degree, even those who joined for bread. The conditions that drove them here were made by the king.
- Do not give any prisoner a profession requiring years of formal training (physician, magistrate, scholar) or backstory that contradicts their age.

### Motivations (use the full range)

- **Hunger and desperation** — no ideology, just survival. They don't hate the king so much as they were starving.
- **Deep personal hatred** — a loved one killed in a raid, a village burned, a family destroyed by a garrison.
- **A prior execution** — someone close was put on a block like this one by a former captain. That detail should land hard when it appears.
- **Pride** — they fought, they killed soldiers, and they are not ashamed to say so.

### Scene

The prisoner kneels with both arms tied behind their back inside a medieval military camp. The Headsman stands in front of them. The power imbalance is absolute. The prisoner cannot move or fight back.

- The Headsman: **unhurried, controlled, pressing**. He has done this before.
- The prisoner: **stripped of everything except words**. Raw, reactive, sometimes defiant, sometimes brittle.

### Storytelling

Each exchange should be a **self-contained story beat** about this specific prisoner. It should reveal their background, motivation, and humanity (or absence of it). The conversation should feel like it matters — the Headsman pressing, the prisoner resisting, both of them arriving somewhere by the end. Avoid filler. Every line should carry weight.

## Examples

### Opening interrogation exchange

```json
"exchanges": [
  [
    "You don't look like you've held a weapon before. What's your name?",
    "{prisonerName}. And I hadn't. Not until six months ago.",
    "What happened six months ago?",
    "The tax collectors came through. My brother argued with them. They beat him to death in the street while the rest of us watched.",
    "And no one intervened.",
    "We were afraid. I'm still ashamed of that. So when the rebels came through and asked who wanted to do something about it, I said yes.",
    "You've been doing something about it for six months, {prisonerName}. Two of my soldiers are dead.",
    "I know. I was there for one of them. I don't sleep well.",
    "Neither do I. That doesn't change what happens next."
  ]
]
```

### Last-words exchanges (`ExecutePrisonerNode`, `headsmanFirst: false`)

```json
"exchanges": [
  [
    "Please. My brother is at home alone. He'll have nothing without me.",
    "I know."
  ],
  [
    "Do it then. I'm not afraid of you.",
    "Good."
  ],
  [
    "Tell my family I didn't break.",
    "I won't be your messenger. Kneel."
  ]
]
```

### Release exchanges (`ReleasePrisonerNode`)

```json
"exchanges": [
  [
    "I can go? Just like that?",
    "Just like that. Don't make me regret it."
  ],
  [
    "Why are you letting me go?",
    "Because it suits me. Walk."
  ],
  [
    "You're going to let me tell people you spared me.",
    "Smart. Now leave before I change my mind."
  ]
]
```

### Strip reaction exchanges (`StripPrisonerNode`)

```json
"exchanges": [
  ["You have no right."],
  ["Don't touch me."],
  ["Stop. Just stop."],
  ["Is this what you call justice?"],
  ["I complied. Was that not enough?"]
]
```

## Patching exchanges into an existing node

You do not need to replace an entire node to add exchanges. Because the merge is shallow, you can patch only the `exchanges` field:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "execute_prisoner",
  "exchanges": [
    [
      "I want to pray first.",
      "Make it quick."
    ],
    [
      "Is there nothing I can say?",
      "Not today."
    ]
  ]
}
```

This replaces the entire exchange pool for `execute_prisoner` with your two exchanges. The `nodeType`, `headsmanFirst`, and all other fields remain as the defaults.
