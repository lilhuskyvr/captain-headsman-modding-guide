title: Exchanges

# Exchanges

Exchanges are the dialogue pools used by `DialogueNode`, `ExecutePrisonerNode`, `StripAndExecutePrisonerNode`, `ReleasePrisonerNode`, and `StripPrisonerNode`. The game picks one exchange at random each time that node is reached.

---

## Format

`exchanges` is an array of arrays. Each inner array is one possible exchange. The game picks one inner array per event and plays its lines in order.

```json
"exchanges": [
  [ "line 0", "line 1", "line 2" ],
  [ "line 0", "line 1" ],
  [ "line 0", "line 1", "line 2", "line 3", "line 4" ]
]
```

---

## Speaker order

Lines within each inner array alternate speakers:

| Index | Speaker (`headsmanFirst: false`) |
|---|---|
| 0 | Prisoner |
| 1 | Headsman |
| 2 | Prisoner |
| 3 | Headsman |
| … | … |

When `headsmanFirst` is set to `true` on the node, the order flips:

| Index | Speaker (`headsmanFirst: true`) |
|---|---|
| 0 | Headsman |
| 1 | Prisoner |
| 2 | Headsman |
| 3 | Prisoner |
| … | … |

`headsmanFirst` defaults to `true` on all nodes, so the Headsman speaks first unless overridden. `ExecutePrisonerNode` (and `StripAndExecutePrisonerNode`) ship with `headsmanFirst: false` in their default JSON so the prisoner delivers last words first. Any node's `headsmanFirst` can be overridden in your mod JSON.

---

## `{prisonerName}` placeholder

Any line may contain `{prisonerName}`. The game replaces it at runtime with the prisoner's generated name.

```json
"I know who you are, {prisonerName}. Word travels.",
```

```json
"Then you know what I've done. Headsman.",
```

---

## `StripPrisonerNode` exchanges

`StripPrisonerNode` and `StripAndDismissPrisonerNode` use single-line exchanges — each inner array contains exactly one string: the prisoner's reaction. The Headsman does not speak during a strip.

```json
"exchanges": [
  ["You have no right."],
  ["Don't touch me."],
  ["Stop. Just stop."],
  ["Is this what you call justice?"]
]
```

## Examples

### Opening interrogation exchange

```json
"exchanges": [
  [
    "You don't look like you've held a weapon before. What's your name?",
    "{prisonerName}. And I hadn't. Not until six months ago.",
    "What happened six months ago?",
    "The tax collectors came through. My brother argued with them. They beat him to death in the street while the rest of us watched.",
    "And no one intervened.",
    "We were afraid. I'm still ashamed of that. So when the rebels came through and asked who wanted to do something about it, I said yes.",
    "You've been doing something about it for six months, {prisonerName}. Two of my soldiers are dead.",
    "I know. I was there for one of them. I don't sleep well.",
    "Neither do I. That doesn't change what happens next."
  ]
]
```

### Last-words exchanges (`ExecutePrisonerNode`, `headsmanFirst: false`)

```json
"exchanges": [
  [
    "Please. My brother is at home alone. He'll have nothing without me.",
    "I know."
  ],
  [
    "Do it then. I'm not afraid of you.",
    "Good."
  ],
  [
    "Tell my family I didn't break.",
    "I won't be your messenger. Kneel."
  ]
]
```

### Release exchanges (`ReleasePrisonerNode`)

```json
"exchanges": [
  [
    "I can go? Just like that?",
    "Just like that. Don't make me regret it."
  ],
  [
    "Why are you letting me go?",
    "Because it suits me. Walk."
  ],
  [
    "You're going to let me tell people you spared me.",
    "Smart. Now leave before I change my mind."
  ]
]
```

### Strip reaction exchanges (`StripPrisonerNode`)

```json
"exchanges": [
  ["You have no right."],
  ["Don't touch me."],
  ["Stop. Just stop."],
  ["Is this what you call justice?"],
  ["I complied. Was that not enough?"]
]
```

## Patching exchanges into an existing node

You do not need to replace an entire node to add exchanges. Because the merge is shallow, you can patch only the `exchanges` field:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "execute_prisoner",
  "exchanges": [
    [
      "I want to pray first.",
      "Make it quick."
    ],
    [
      "Is there nothing I can say?",
      "Not today."
    ]
  ]
}
```

This replaces the entire exchange pool for `execute_prisoner` with your two exchanges. The `nodeType`, `headsmanFirst`, and all other fields remain as the defaults.
