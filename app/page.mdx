# Captain Headsman — Modding Guide

Captain Headsman is moddable through plain JSON files placed in the `StreamingAssets` folder. No compilation, no special tools. Open a text editor, write your JSON, drop it in the right folder, launch the game.

---

## How the mod system works

The game loads every `.json` file found anywhere inside `StreamingAssets/` at startup. Files are grouped by their `"id"` field. If two files share the same `id`, they are **shallow-merged** in alphabetical filename order — later files overwrite earlier ones at the top level. Your mod file only needs to contain the fields you want to change; everything else stays as the default.

```
StreamingAssets/
  Default/          ← shipped defaults (do not edit these)
    Characters/
    Nodes/
    GameSettings.json
  Mods/             ← your mod files go here
    MyGameSettingsMod.json
    MyMaleRebelMod.json
    …
```

> Place your files anywhere inside `StreamingAssets/`. The subfolder name does not matter. Using `Mods/` is the recommended convention.

## File anatomy

Every JSON file the game loads must have at minimum:

```json
{
  "$type": "<fully qualified C# type name>",
  "id":    "<unique identifier string>"
}
```

The `$type` field tells the deserializer which data class to use. The `id` field identifies which data object this file belongs to (or creates).

| Purpose | `$type` value |
|---|---|
| Game settings | `Scripts.DataComponents.GameSettingsDataObject, Assembly-CSharp` |
| Character definition | `Scripts.DataComponents.CharacterDataObject, Assembly-CSharp` |
| Node definition | `Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp` |

## Quick-start: your first mod

1. Create a file at `StreamingAssets/Mods/MyFirstMod.json`.
2. Paste the following to disable the stripping options from the verdict screen:

```json
{
  "$type": "Scripts.DataComponents.NodeDataObject, Assembly-CSharp",
  "id": "execute_or_release",
  "nodeType": "OptionNode",
  "options": [
    { "text": "Execute", "nodeId": "execute_prisoner" },
    { "text": "Release", "nodeId": "release_prisoner" }
  ]
}
```

3. Launch the game. The verdict screen now only shows Execute and Release.

That is all there is to it.
